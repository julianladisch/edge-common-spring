## Introduction

This is a shared library/framework for edge APIs for spring way modules.
This module is a port of [edge-common](https://github.com/folio-org/edge-common), and main goal is feature parity with that framework. 
From a hosting/SysOps perspective, edge modules developed with this framework should be indistinguishable from those developed using edge-common.

## Overview
The intent of edge-common-spring is to simplify the implementation of edge APIs by providing much of the boilerplate code shared among these APIs.
